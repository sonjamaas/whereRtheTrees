Title: Find the Closest Public Nature Point
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Sonja Maas
Description: Find the closest public nature point to your current
    Position.  The route is calculated in the "car" profile of osrm,
    therefore there might be a point that is closer to you if you are by
    foot or by bike.  For other profiles, please set up a server.
